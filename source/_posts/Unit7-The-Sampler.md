Unit Seven: The Sampler
====

The author finds out that good intentions alone are not enough when
his attempt to be kind to an old man leaves them both feeling worse than
before.

**find out**

I have often wondered whether some people, who had no intention of making a purchase,
would take advantage of this privilege.

我经常会奇怪，
One day I asked this question of shop girl, and I learned it was indeed the case.

有一天我问了店员女孩这个问题，
"Now there's one old gentleman, for instance," she told me, " he comes here
almost every week and samples each one of the puddings, though he never buys
anything, and I suspect he never will. I remember him from last year before
that, too. Well, let him come if he wants it, and welcome to it. And what's more
, I hope there are a lot more stores where he can go and get his share. He looks as
if he needed it all right, and I suppose they can afford it ."

She was still speaking when an elderly gentleman limped up to the counter and
began looking closely at the row of puddings with great interest.

"Why, that's the very gentleman I've been telling you about," whispered the shop girl."
Just watch him now. "And then turning to him:" Would you like to sample them, sir? Here's
spoon for you to use."

The elderly gentleman, who was poorly but neatly dressed, accepted the spoon and began eagerly
to sample one after another of the puddings, only braking off occasionally to wipe his
red eyes with a large torn handkerchief.

"This is quite good."

"This is not bad either, but a little too heavy."

All the time it was quite evident that he sincerely believed that he might eventually buy one
of these puddings, and I am positive that he did not for a moment feel that he was in any way cheating
the store. Poor old chap! Probably he had come down in the world and this sampling was all that was
left him from the time when he could afford to come and select his favorite pudding.

Amidst the crowd of happy, prosperous looking Christmas shoppers, the little black figure of the of
man seemed pitiful and out of place, and in a burst of benevolence, I went up to him and said:
"Pardon me, sir, will you do me a favor? Let me purchase you one of these puddings. It would give me
such pleasure."

He jumped back as if he had been stung, and the blood rushed into his wrinkled face.

"Excuse me," he said, with more dignity than I would have thought possible
